ðŸš¨ Women Safety Tracking Device Using Arduino Nano ðŸš¨

In today's world, safety is a priority, and I developed a Women Safety Tracking Device to help address this need.

ðŸ”¹ How it works:
When in an emergency, the user simply presses a push button, and the device instantly captures their real-time GPS location (using the Neo 6M GPS module) and sends it via GSM module to a predefined mobile number.
The location details can help family, friends, or authorities to quickly reach the person in need.

ðŸ”¹ Components Used:

Arduino Nano
16x2 LCD Display
GSM Module
Neo 6M GPS Module
Push Button
Breadboard and Jumper Wires

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Quick alert system with a single button press.
Live location tracking sent via SMS.
Compact and portable design using Arduino Nano.
Visual status display on the 16x2 LCD screen.
This project aims to create an affordable, accessible, and effective safety solution for women, children, and anyone who may find themselves in distress situations.

ðŸ’¬ I'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or ways to improve it!
